Project Title: Employee Management System
Project Description:
The Employee Management System is a simple and user-friendly desktop application designed using Python and Tkinter. It provides a straightforward interface to collect and manage employee data for a startup or small-scale organization. The application allows users to input and store employee details in a local SQLite database and retrieve the stored records in an organized manner.
This system is particularly beneficial for organizations aiming to maintain a small database of employees without needing extensive software solutions.
